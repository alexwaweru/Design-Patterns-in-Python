# Design Patterns in Python #
Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced 
object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions
to general problems that software developers faced during software
development.

You can think of a pattern as an especially clever and 
insightful way of solving a particular class of problems. That is,
 it looks like a lot of people have worked out all the angles of a 
 problem and have come up with the most general, flexible solution 
 for it. The problem could be one you have seen and solved before, 
 but your solution probably didn’t have the kind of completeness 
 you’ll see embodied in a pattern.

Often, the most difficult part of developing an elegant and 
cheap-to-maintain design is in discovering what I call 
“the vector of change.” (Here, “vector” refers to the 
maximum gradient and not a container class.) This means 
finding the most important thing that changes in your system, 
or put another way, discovering where your greatest cost is. 
Once you discover the vector of change, you have the focal 
point around which to structure your design. So the goal of design
 patterns is to isolate changes in your code.
 
I have researched and tried to implement the following design patterns:
1. Singleton
